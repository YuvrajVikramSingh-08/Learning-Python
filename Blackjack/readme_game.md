Hi everyone!!

This is my first minor project of my journey of learning to code in PYTHON.

This is a simple version of BlackJack game(AKA: 21), I have worked on this game to learn conditional statements, function creation and logic building.
I have not added any brain for computer's side. Only the player can deal new card.

Computer will only get two cards while you can keep asking for more cards till you get your score closest to 21.

play the full version of game here: https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack

Hope You Enjoyed!!
Thanks!
